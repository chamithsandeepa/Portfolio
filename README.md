# Portfolio
Here is my personal portfolio website, created using HTML and CSS. It includes several pages: Home, About, Goal, Work, Achievement, Talent, and Contact. Each page provides insight into different parts of my background, such as my skills, accomplishments, career goals, and how to get in touch with me.
